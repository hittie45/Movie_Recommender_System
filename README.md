Movie Recommender System with Machine Learning
Overview
This project is a movie recommender system that utilizes machine learning techniques to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system employs collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and natural language processing (NLP) for content-based filtering to generate personalized recommendations.

Features
User Registration: Users can create accounts and provide preferences to personalize their recommendations.
Movie Recommendations: The system generates personalized movie recommendations for each user based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific movies and receive recommendations based on their search queries.
Rating System: Users can rate movies they have watched, which helps improve the accuracy of recommendations.
Machine Learning Models: The system employs machine learning models for collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which are trained on historical user-movie interactions and movie attributes, respectively.
